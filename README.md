# Tauri + React + Typescript

# Caffeine Clipper
Make clips while you stream quickly and easily! 

# Progress

## DONE

* This can use a given bearer token and client ID to create clips from the given channel!
* Saves settings locally.

## TO DO

* Find a way to capture bearer from token redirect on twitch auth page.
* Make the hotkeys work when in system tray or just minimized.
* Automatically save settings and update broadcast ID on typing stop.
* Set up CD to automatically make and pin a build when a tag is made.
* Save clip history locally per channel.

## Maybe

* Open clips editor in minimal browser in app rather than a browser window.
* Export clips as vertical vids via FFMPEG (borrow some Pillar code)
* Use whisper to listen for trigger words? May be overkill.
